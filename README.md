Time series analysis and forecasting play a crucial role in understanding and predicting patterns within sequential data. This study focuses on applying time series analysis techniques to historical sales data from a superstore, aiming to derive meaningful insights and develop accurate forecasting models. The dataset encompasses information on sales over time, providing an opportunity to uncover trends, seasonality, and other temporal patterns that can influence business decisions. The research employs various time series analysis methods, including decomposition to separate the data into trend, seasonal, and residual components. This study focuses on the application of Time Series Analysis and Forecasting techniques to Superstore sales data, employing two prominent methods: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Prophet. Time series data, characterized by temporal dependencies, is prevalent in various domains, including retail. Understanding and predicting sales patterns in a Superstore environment is crucial for effective inventory management, resource allocation, and strategic decision-making. The first component of the analysis involves exploring historical sales data through data mining techniques, uncovering underlying patterns, trends, and potential seasonality. Descriptive statistics and visualizations are employed to gain insights into the temporal dynamics of the sales dataset. Subsequently, the study transitions into the realm of machine learning, implementing ARIMA and Prophet models for forecasting future sales. ARIMA, a classical time series forecasting method, relies on autoregressive and moving average components, while Prophet, developed by Facebook, incorporates seasonality, holidays, and other external factors to capture complex patterns. The evaluation of model performance involves assessing the accuracy of predictions through metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Comparative analysis between ARIMA and Prophet allows for an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each method in the context of Superstore sales forecasting. The findings from this research contribute not only to the optimization of Superstore operations but also to the broader understanding of time series analysis and forecasting methodologies. The application of ARIMA and Prophet in the retail domain demonstrates their effectiveness in capturing the intricate dynamics of sales data, providing valuable insights for businesses seeking to enhance their decision-making processes in a dynamic and time-dependent environment.
